Editor David Horovitz and Knesset correspondent Carrie Keller-Lynn join host Amanda Borschel-Dan in today's episode. Yesterday, the Knesset\u00a0passed in a 64-0 vote the first major bill of the government\u2019s judicial overhaul. Chaos immediately erupted and protesters blocked roads and clashed with police across the country for hours. Keller-Lynn sets the scene for us. Horovitz wrote an op-ed yesterday that ended with the suggestion that while the coalition secured a victory, Israel has sustained a dangerous defeat. He shares thoughts on the mood of the country. The Biden administration quickly responded to the passage of the reasonableness bill, as did major Diaspora Jewish organizations. What were they saying? As of recording time, there are at least six petitions to the High Court over the bill's passage, including from the Movement for Quality Government in Israel (MQG)\u00a0and the Israel Bar Association. What are some of their arguments and are we heading to a showdown between the judicial and executive branches? This morning an additional bill is being floated by United Torah Judaism -- and it too has societal-rending significance. Discussed articles include: Netanyahu\u2019s judicial overhaul victory spells a tragic, disastrous defeat for Israel Coalition passes 1st judicial overhaul law, limiting review of government decisions Gallant explains vote for contentious overhaul bill: \u2018Best that I stay at the wheel\u2019 White House laments unilateral passage of overhaul bill, as Democrats echo alarm \u2018First step to destroying democracy\u2019: Diaspora groups alarmed as overhaul law passes High Court justices rush back from abroad to hear petitions against \u2018reasonableness\u2019 Subscribe to The Times of Israel Daily Briefing on\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify,\u00a0PlayerFM,\u00a0Google Play, or wherever you get your podcasts.

She is the creator and host of the podcast, A Slight Change of Plans. We discuss how our identities develop and change, how our beliefs and internal narratives shape our perception of self, and how to use structured introspection about our values to determine our goals. We discuss how to cope and grow through uncertain situations, especially those that force us to reexamine our roles and identity. Dr. Shankar shares her experience of redefining her identity after an early career-ending setback. She also explains numerous science-based strategies to effectively define goals, structure our goal pursuits and maintain consistent motivation. This episode provides a science-supported toolkit and roadmap to assess your identity and goals and positively transform in the face of change. For the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com.

Magid and Berman discuss the details of President Isaac Herzog's speech to the US Congress, including the focus on the judicial overhaul and the protests against it -- and whether or not they mark the strength of Israel's democracy. They note Herzog's skill in walking a diplomatic tightrope, bridging the gaps between US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They also look at Herzog's meeting with Biden prior to the speech, and why the Israeli president came to the US to speak to the US president at this point in time. Magid discusses a long-awaited pilot of the US Visa Waiver Program (VWP) which will begin easing travel restrictions for Palestinian Americans to travel through Israel's Ben Gurion International Airport and at Israeli border crossings.

Diplomatic correspondent Lazar Berman and Diaspora reporter Canaan Lidor join host Amanda Borschel-Dan in today's episode. Foreign Minister Eli Cohen met with a number of African officials in the Kenyan capital of Nairobi on Sunday. Hebrew media has reported on an off-record meetup with an official of a country that does not currently have ties with Israel. Which country could it be? President Isaac Herzog is flying to the US late tonight. Who is unhappy with the trip and what is planned for the president? During his weekly Saturday night sermon, Yitzhak Yosef, the Sephardic chief rabbi of Israel, accused National Security Minister Itamar Ben Gvir of \u201csinning and causing others to sin\u201d by visiting the Temple Mount. What instigated this outburst? In a story that lit up international headlines, a Muslim activist who had received permission to burn a Torah and a Bible outside the Israeli embassy in Sweden on Saturday said he was backing off from the move. What did local Jews have to say? The Ministry of Aliyah and Integration has ended a so-called fast track for Russian and Belarusian applicants, citing low demand for the service despite increasing arrivals amid Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the ongoing war. Lidor gives a 360-degree explanation.

Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida will join some new House leaders including Congressman Wesley Hunt of Texas and Congresswoman Nikema Williams of Georgia. The caucus aims to raise awareness of sensitivities in both the Black and Jewish communities, combat stereotypes, and showcase commonalities. And with us this week to talk about their efforts to do the same are Candace Bazemore and Gabby Leon Spatt, co-authors of the children\u2019s book Shabbat and Sunday Dinner, which was honored with the Award of Excellence from the Religion Communicators Council. Both are members of the Black/Jewish Coalition and participants in AJC\u2019s Project Understanding, a biannual weekend of dialogue to develop understanding and friendships between leaders of the Black and Jewish communities. Our guest host this week is Dov Wilker, AJC\u2019s Director of Black Jewish Relations. Dov, the mic is yours. Dov Wilker: Thank you, Manya. Candace and Gabby, welcome to People of the Pod. Candace Bazemore: Thank you. We're excited to be here. Gabby Leon Spatt: It's a great opportunity. We're really excited to chat with you.\u00a0 Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0 Well, wonderful, we're just gonna jump right on in. And so I'm curious, Gabby, Candace, how did y'all meet? And how did you go from being friends to co-authors? Gabby Leon Spatt: Candace and I are both transplants to Atlanta, growing up in Florida, Virginia, both moving here for college or after college. And our original meeting actually was through the Junior League of Atlanta. We served on a committee together and launched a leadership program that was trading opportunities for Junior League members. But when we really met and realized how much we really adore each other, love each other, learn from each other, was from our shared experience of both attending Project Understanding, which is a program of Atlanta's AJC office, the Black-Jewish Coalition. And once we realized we both had that experience, our conversations changed, our friendship deepened, we really had the opportunity to share to learn to have meaningful conversations. And one day, we were planning an alumni event for Project Understanding participants, and we kind of talked about writing a book. And I'll let Candace share a little bit more about that. Candace Bazemore: Yeah, well, first of all, knowing how we met is like a very cool thing, because it just showcases some of the great ways that Atlanta already has great systems and organizations in place to help people look for ways to build across different community lines. I probably would have never met Gabby otherwise, which means that the book that we wrote together would have never happened. And the way the book came about was actually really cool. During the pandemic, we got tapped to help be on a planning committee for the Project Understanding\u2019s alumni New Year's Day brunch, which was going to be virtual, since no one could go anywhere, because of COVID. In the middle of one of the planning sessions, actually, at the start of one of the planning sessions, we were waiting for the two guys to join, of course, all the ladies got on first. And... Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0 I take offense to that.\u00a0 Candace Bazemore: It's fine. It's okay. It's true, though. And so we were discussing what we were planning on having for the brunch, because we were encouraging everyone to find a traditional meal to have for the brunch so people could be eating and talking, even though we couldn't be in the same place. And Gabby shared, she was going to have bagels and lox and I said chicken and waffles. But I didn't know like, what's bagels and lox? And we're like, Wouldn't it be a great idea to share recipes as a way to unite people? And then that led to us to kind of discussing like, you know, well, there's tons of recipe books out there. But what if we tried to get people earlier to start thinking about it. And so that's how we got to the idea of a children's book.\u00a0 Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0 Wait, I have to ask, have either of you written a children's book before? Gabby Leon Spatt: Definitely not, no. Candace Bazemore: No, this is our first children's book. I've written a ton of blogs. Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0 Have you ever written a book before? Candace Bazemore: No, not since being like a little, no. Everybody does, like young authors or something like that in school, but not a book book. This is our first. Gabby Leon Spatt: We like stretch projects. We like to try new things in between taking care of our friends, our families, our full time jobs, you know. Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0 You've got boundless energy, the two of you.\u00a0 Gabby Leon Spatt: Yes we do. Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0 What do you hope that readers are gonna gain from the book? I mean, in the year or so since it's been released, what's been the response? Gabby Leon Spatt: The experience, the stories we hear, I mean, I'll be sitting in a meeting, and somebody says, I read that book to my granddaughter, and it's the only one she wants to read now, and she just took so much away from it. But for us, I think the big picture is when you open your stomach at a dinner table, there's a way to start to open your heart and your mind. And Candace and I have shared so many life events together, holiday dinners, Shabbat dinners, Sunday dinners, just real times, where we've had that opportunity to kind of dive in and when you taste something new or something different, and you're at someone's home or their family member cooks it\u2013there's always a story that goes behind it.\u00a0 And that's really the inspiration of this book is that the dinner table is a special place that brings people, ideas, and cultures together. And we thought, how do we tell this story, and the story was about telling our own family traditions, and what we typically do when we celebrate a Friday night Shabbat dinner, or a Sunday dinner.\u00a0 And so the characters, you know, are loosely mirrored after us and our families, and what the dinner means to us. And so the story follows two friends through their class presentations, as they learn more about each other's family traditions. And the hope is that the book introduces readers to other cultures and communities, and that we pique some interest in learning about other traditions. And the book is a great, you know, conversation starter, not just for children, but even for adults who maybe haven't had some of those unique experiences. For us, it was really important to be able to tell them more than just the story within the book. But we tell a little bit of the history of Black-Jewish relations. And we also have a page that is continuing the conversation. Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0 I'm curious, Candace, has that been your experience as well, I mean, you sit in a meeting, and someone tells you about the book that they've read that their grandchild only wants to only wants to read that, or you got another story?\u00a0 Candace Bazemore: Yeah, actually, I have a couple of stories like that, I actually had an opportunity to speak at a children's center here in Virginia. And the kids were so excited, they were sharing their family dinner traditions, and things like that. So that was very cool that came from the book reading. And we've had, I was actually in a meeting last night and a program associated with AJC, and we were all talking about some plans for a program for young people. And one of the organizers mentioned about our book, and two of the people in the meeting had the book that they read to their young kids. And that's their favorite book. So it was like, very cool. I was like, Oh, my god, yeah, that's great.\u00a0 But one of the coolest things, I'm in a friend's group with Gabby and some other black and Jewish women. And one of the members, when we first launched the book, she ordered it on Amazon, and it got delivered to her neighbor's house by accident. And she had never met the neighbor, the neighbor just opened, because of course, it was during the pandemic,\u00a0 the height of everybody getting Amazon orders. And so she just was like, Oh, this must be my order. She opens it up. It's a book, she doesn't know what it is. But it's, you know, the cover was inviting, she opened it up, she read the whole book, and then she put it back in the envelope with a personal note to our friend, and said, hey, you know, I got this book by mistake, I was really excited and really love this story. The images inside, the message, and I read some of the questions at the end. I'd love to get together with you over dinner, to talk more about it, because I'd love to learn more about your community. So that's how she became friends with her neighbor through the book. So it's very cool.\u00a0 Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0 That's really an incredible story for so many reasons. So this Thursday, July 13, AJC's marking the relaunch of the Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations, where the two of you will be sharing your story. What do you hope our nation's leaders will gain from hearing about your experience? Gabby Leon Spatt: So we're really excited to be at the relaunch of the Congressional Caucus. I think, for us, the hope is for people to know that this work is happening, these communities are engaging already, revisiting the past, this is not a new relationship. This is one that is rooted in many, many, many years of friendship, of teaching, of learning. And it's still happening. It's just maybe happening, you know, in a new way. I hope that we're able to inspire those that are in the room, including the congressmen and the congresswomen to really make this part of the agenda, to really celebrate the relationship and show the impact we can make and that we are making. Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0 I love that. I couldn't agree more. So the goals of the caucus are to raise awareness, provide resources and unite black and Jewish, and black-Jewish communities to combat hate and stereotypes. How do you think the caucus can achieve that? Big picture here. Candace Bazemore: First of all, it's a great question. I'm gonna give you a little bit of background about myself. And the fact that I actually was in college, a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation congressional intern. So I spent a summer working on the hill, in Congressman Scott, Robert C. Scott's office, Bobby Scott, from the Third District of Virginia. And it was very cool to see some of the great things they were doing to help shape young minds and future leaders. And I think that the caucus and the role of congressional leaders and just leadership in general requires you to look at ways to unite and to get your constituents and your communities that you touch, to look for ways to work together.\u00a0 I mean, the goal of a congressperson is to take their district and help make it better. I know in recent years, we've seen leadership go in the wrong direction. But these leaders have the opportunity to build bridges instead of tear them down. And so they can be the catalyst for change in their communities, they have the ability to direct resources and to direct attention, as well as to put their time on these topics. So they're already doing it by obviously relaunching the program and the caucus. And so the next step is then to empower their constituents to start these dialogues, start these conversations. And, and I think this gives them a reason, and also the organizations that they touch, a reason to start looking for ways to unite these communities. Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0 Excellent. So, you know, I want to take it a little more local, before we go back to the macro national level. Can you tell us more about your experience with Project Understanding? So for those that don't know, our listeners, AJC's Atlanta office has been running this, Marvin C. Goldstein Project Understanding Black Jewish retreat, every other year, since 1990-ish. We bring together 18 black and Jewish and some black-Jewish leaders to be a part of the conversation. So 36, in total. For 24 hours of intense dialogue. So I'm wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about that experience for you. And if you've been involved since then, beyond writing this book together, and I think Candace, you even referenced a new initiative that you're a part of, so I was wondering, if you could share a little bit more about that, too. Gabby Leon Spatt: Yes. So, you know, I mentioned earlier, the retreat was just eye opening, really moving. You know, I grew up, the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, we were told, you always love everybody. The idea in my family of not liking somebody just because of their skin color, or their culture or their religion. It just didn't exist. And I don't know that I noticed, you know, growing up, I was already kind of doing some of this work.\u00a0 And I had a mentor of mine in college, who was my Greek advisor. And we talked a lot about black and Jewish relations at the time, he asked me to make him, challah French toast because he always associated challah with Jewish. And I said, Sure. And I went to church with him, actually, here in Atlanta, we were here for a conference. And, you know, it just kind of happened authentically. And coming to Atlanta and getting connected with AJC, and the Black-Jewish Coalition. And then Project Understanding. I think I realized how powerful the experiences I had in the past were, and this just felt like home for me. And it's also, Dov, it's incredible to see how you've invested more into the program and opened it up to a generation above, reaching 40 to 55 year olds, but also this year, launching a high school program. And so I think the impact of the retreat, that happens immediately, but also has a long lasting impact, we've really been able to make change within the Atlanta community. Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0 Candace, how about for you? Candace Bazemore: Yeah. Well, you know, first of all, Gabby touched on all the things that are dear to my heart about, you know, what we've learned along the way in our journey together. I kind of like listening to her talk about some of the programs were a part of. I mean, to see people from Project Understanding, the Black Jewish Coalition at events for the United Way or for the Junior League. I recently hosted a fundraiser for the Amario's Art Academy, which was a sneaker ball to help this, this program that helps young kids connect with arts and art opportunities that they wouldn't normally have, because they don't have the access to afford expensive art programs. And to have Gabby and her husband show up and have such a great time, and other people from other programs that were associated. So it's great to see how much the community building how it blends across everything that helps the community grow and be more diverse. And she even mentioned the the team program, through Project Understanding, it's the Black Jewish Teen Initiative is what it's called. So applications are open for this great program where the teens get to participate, they're high school juniors and seniors from across Greater Atlanta, coming together to learn about, black Jewish relationships, to learn about, like the impact of racism, antisemitism, to learn about diversity within the black and Jewish communities. So I mean, I'm just super excited about some of the things that have come from these programs. And, and the fact that we're more forward thinking. So the idea of the book is a way to get in front of young minds, the idea of this program is to get in front of teen minds, the Project Understanding traditional program is for those emerging leaders. And now the new programs that are for people who maybe weren't around when these programs existed to instill, learn and build communities as they get older. We're looking at the whole life of people, how do you build relationships your whole life, so that those communities when you need them already there, you already know someone you can pick up the phone and say, Hey, how do I do this? What's the best way to do this? Or I made a mistake? How do I improve? How do I correct this? By having these relationships, there's more opportunity for grace. So, you know, gaps may happen, mistakes can happen. But if you have relationships, you have something that you can, dip into and say, Hey, how do we do things better? How do we do things differently?\u00a0 Gabby Leon Spatt: I think it's also, you know, special to point out, we're one story, we\u2019re one outcome, right? There have been other individuals who have participated in Project understanding, who have started a barbecue team at the Atlanta Kosher BBQ Festival, which happens to be the largest kosher barbecue festival in the entire country. And that, you know, became a learning experience, just for themselves to be on the team, you had to go through Project Understanding, you know, and there's this cultural experience of explaining what kosher meat is. And you don't want to put extra salt in the rub, because it\u2019s already salted right. And when you like, the, you know, the barbecue, that has to be after Shabbat on sundown on Saturday, and the mashgiach has to light it. And then it's like, Who is that, right? And so the stuff that's happening in our community is so authentic, it just is happening, and it's so nice to see people just wanting to learn and continue the conversation past just the retreat. Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0 I can also share that as an attendee of the BBQ Festival. It\u2019s not just that they're there together,they're grilling good meat. It's a very tasty experience to attend. Alright, so one final question. What are ways that we can highlight the positive worker interactions between our two communities? Candace Bazemore: Well, that's a great question. I always say the best way to highlight it is to ask people to share their individual stories. And me being a digital person, definitely utilize social media in order to get the word out about the ways that you know you're working together. If you're in a room with someone who doesn't look like you, and you're working on these tough problems and coming up with great solutions. share a post about that, encourage someone else to do that, too. If you have an event coming up, invite someone else out to come with it, that normally wouldn't be in the room. So I don't know how many times me and Gabby have been the only ones of us in a room before. A great example. I was in town during the great challah bake. And 300 Jewish women at the-was it at the Bernie Marcus center?\u00a0 Gabby Leon Spatt: Yes, the Jewish Community Center.\u00a0 Candace Bazemore: Jewish Community Center. Yeah. And so I was the only black woman or maybe one or two in the whole room?\u00a0 Gabby Leon Spatt: It was just you. Candace Bazemore: It was just me, okay. And was having a good old time making some challah bread. Because challah\u2019s my thing. Obviously, Gabby has shown me how to make challah bread. So I'm actually pretty good at it. She's getting good at deep fried cornbread as a matter of fact as well.\u00a0 Gabby Leon Spatt: Oh it's so good. I think it's opportunities like this, being able to be invited to share your story. And I think the caucus is really going to highlight a lot of what is happening across the country already, and give, you know, local advocates on the ground doing the work the opportunity to shine and to tell their story, because I think more than anything, storytelling is impactful, and it hits, at people's hearts and people's minds, and in our case, people's stomachs. Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0 Well, thank you, Gabby, and Candice, Candice and Gabby, we are so grateful for the book that you've written for the delicious food, that you're helping to inspire being made across this beautiful country, and to your participation in the relaunch of the Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish relations.\u00a0 Candace Bazemore: Thank you. Dov.\u00a0 Gabby Leon Spatt: Thanks.

Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida will join some new House leaders including Congressman Wesley Hunt of Texas and Congresswoman Nikema Williams of Georgia. The caucus aims to raise awareness of sensitivities in both the Black and Jewish communities, combat stereotypes, and showcase commonalities. And with us this week to talk about their efforts to do the same are Candace Bazemore and Gabby Leon Spatt, co-authors of the children\u2019s book Shabbat and Sunday Dinner, which was honored with the Award of Excellence from the Religion Communicators Council. Both are members of the Black/Jewish Coalition and participants in AJC\u2019s Project Understanding, a biannual weekend of dialogue to develop understanding and friendships between leaders of the Black and Jewish communities. Our guest host this week is Dov Wilker, AJC\u2019s Director of Black Jewish Relations. Dov, the mic is yours.</p> <p>Dov Wilker:</p> <p>Thank you, Manya. Candace and Gabby, welcome to People of the Pod.</p> <p>Candace Bazemore:</p> <p>Thank you. We&#39;re excited to be here.</p> <p>Gabby Leon Spatt:</p> <p>It&#39;s a great opportunity. We&#39;re really excited to chat with you.\u00a0</p> <p>Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Well, wonderful, we&#39;re just gonna jump right on in. And so I&#39;m curious, Gabby, Candace, how did y&#39;all meet? And how did you go from being friends to co-authors?</p> <p>Gabby Leon Spatt:</p> <p>Candace and I are both transplants to Atlanta, growing up in Florida, Virginia, both moving here for college or after college. And our original meeting actually was through the Junior League of Atlanta. We served on a committee together and launched a leadership program that was trading opportunities for Junior League members. But when we really met and realized how much we really adore each other, love each other, learn from each other, was from our shared experience of both attending Project Understanding, which is a program of Atlanta&#39;s AJC office, the Black-Jewish Coalition. And once we realized we both had that experience, our conversations changed, our friendship deepened, we really had the opportunity to share to learn to have meaningful conversations. And one day, we were planning an alumni event for Project Understanding participants, and we kind of talked about writing a book. And I&#39;ll let Candace share a little bit more about that.</p> <p>Candace Bazemore:</p> <p>Yeah, well, first of all, knowing how we met is like a very cool thing, because it just showcases some of the great ways that Atlanta already has great systems and organizations in place to help people look for ways to build across different community lines. I probably would have never met Gabby otherwise, which means that the book that we wrote together would have never happened. And the way the book came about was actually really cool. During the pandemic, we got tapped to help be on a planning committee for the Project Understanding\u2019s alumni New Year&#39;s Day brunch, which was going to be virtual, since no one could go anywhere, because of COVID. In the middle of one of the planning sessions, actually, at the start of one of the planning sessions, we were waiting for the two guys to join, of course, all the ladies got on first. And...</p> <p>Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>I take offense to that.\u00a0</p> <p>Candace Bazemore:</p> <p>It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s okay. It&#39;s true, though. And so we were discussing what we were planning on having for the brunch, because we were encouraging everyone to find a traditional meal to have for the brunch so people could be eating and talking, even though we couldn&#39;t be in the same place. And Gabby shared, she was going to have bagels and lox and I said chicken and waffles. But I didn&#39;t know like, what&#39;s bagels and lox? And we&#39;re like, Wouldn&#39;t it be a great idea to share recipes as a way to unite people? And then that led to us to kind of discussing like, you know, well, there&#39;s tons of recipe books out there. But what if we tried to get people earlier to start thinking about it. And so that&#39;s how we got to the idea of a children&#39;s book.\u00a0</p> <p>Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Wait, I have to ask, have either of you written a children&#39;s book before?</p> <p>Gabby Leon Spatt:</p> <p>Definitely not, no.</p> <p>Candace Bazemore:</p> <p>No, this is our first children&#39;s book. I&#39;ve written a ton of blogs.</p> <p>Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Have you ever written a book before?</p> <p>Candace Bazemore:</p> <p>No, not since being like a little, no. Everybody does, like young authors or something like that in school, but not a book book. This is our first.</p> <p>Gabby Leon Spatt:</p> <p>We like stretch projects. We like to try new things in between taking care of our friends, our families, our full time jobs, you know.</p> <p>Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>You&#39;ve got boundless energy, the two of you.\u00a0</p> <p>Gabby Leon Spatt:</p> <p>Yes we do.</p> <p>Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>What do you hope that readers are gonna gain from the book? I mean, in the year or so since it&#39;s been released, what&#39;s been the response?</p> <p>Gabby Leon Spatt:</p> <p>The experience, the stories we hear, I mean, I&#39;ll be sitting in a meeting, and somebody says, I read that book to my granddaughter, and it&#39;s the only one she wants to read now, and she just took so much away from it. But for us, I think the big picture is when you open your stomach at a dinner table, there&#39;s a way to start to open your heart and your mind. And Candace and I have shared so many life events together, holiday dinners, Shabbat dinners, Sunday dinners, just real times, where we&#39;ve had that opportunity to kind of dive in and when you taste something new or something different, and you&#39;re at someone&#39;s home or their family member cooks it\u2013there&#39;s always a story that goes behind it.\u00a0</p> <p>And that&#39;s really the inspiration of this book is that the dinner table is a special place that brings people, ideas, and cultures together. And we thought, how do we tell this story, and the story was about telling our own family traditions, and what we typically do when we celebrate a Friday night Shabbat dinner, or a Sunday dinner.\u00a0</p> <p>And so the characters, you know, are loosely mirrored after us and our families, and what the dinner means to us. And so the story follows two friends through their class presentations, as they learn more about each other&#39;s family traditions. And the hope is that the book introduces readers to other cultures and communities, and that we pique some interest in learning about other traditions. And the book is a great, you know, conversation starter, not just for children, but even for adults who maybe haven&#39;t had some of those unique experiences. For us, it was really important to be able to tell them more than just the story within the book. But we tell a little bit of the history of Black-Jewish relations. And we also have a page that is continuing the conversation.</p> <p>Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>I&#39;m curious, Candace, has that been your experience as well, I mean, you sit in a meeting, and someone tells you about the book that they&#39;ve read that their grandchild only wants to only wants to read that, or you got another story?\u00a0</p> <p>Candace Bazemore:</p> <p>Yeah, actually, I have a couple of stories like that, I actually had an opportunity to speak at a children&#39;s center here in Virginia. And the kids were so excited, they were sharing their family dinner traditions, and things like that. So that was very cool that came from the book reading. And we&#39;ve had, I was actually in a meeting last night and a program associated with AJC, and we were all talking about some plans for a program for young people. And one of the organizers mentioned about our book, and two of the people in the meeting had the book that they read to their young kids. And that&#39;s their favorite book. So it was like, very cool. I was like, Oh, my god, yeah, that&#39;s great.\u00a0</p> <p>But one of the coolest things, I&#39;m in a friend&#39;s group with Gabby and some other black and Jewish women. And one of the members, when we first launched the book, she ordered it on Amazon, and it got delivered to her neighbor&#39;s house by accident. And she had never met the neighbor, the neighbor just opened, because of course, it was during the pandemic,\u00a0 the height of everybody getting Amazon orders. And so she just was like, Oh, this must be my order. She opens it up. It&#39;s a book, she doesn&#39;t know what it is. But it&#39;s, you know, the cover was inviting, she opened it up, she read the whole book, and then she put it back in the envelope with a personal note to our friend, and said, hey, you know, I got this book by mistake, I was really excited and really love this story. The images inside, the message, and I read some of the questions at the end. I&#39;d love to get together with you over dinner, to talk more about it, because I&#39;d love to learn more about your community. So that&#39;s how she became friends with her neighbor through the book. So it&#39;s very cool.\u00a0</p> <p>Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>That&#39;s really an incredible story for so many reasons. So this Thursday, July 13, AJC&#39;s marking the relaunch of the Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations, where the two of you will be sharing your story. What do you hope our nation&#39;s leaders will gain from hearing about your experience?</p> <p>Gabby Leon Spatt:</p> <p>So we&#39;re really excited to be at the relaunch of the Congressional Caucus. I think, for us, the hope is for people to know that this work is happening, these communities are engaging already, revisiting the past, this is not a new relationship. This is one that is rooted in many, many, many years of friendship, of teaching, of learning. And it&#39;s still happening. It&#39;s just maybe happening, you know, in a new way. I hope that we&#39;re able to inspire those that are in the room, including the congressmen and the congresswomen to really make this part of the agenda, to really celebrate the relationship and show the impact we can make and that we are making.</p> <p>Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>I love that. I couldn&#39;t agree more. So the goals of the caucus are to raise awareness, provide resources and unite black and Jewish, and black-Jewish communities to combat hate and stereotypes. How do you think the caucus can achieve that? Big picture here.</p> <p>Candace Bazemore:</p> <p>First of all, it&#39;s a great question. I&#39;m gonna give you a little bit of background about myself. And the fact that I actually was in college, a Congressional Black Caucus Foundation congressional intern. So I spent a summer working on the hill, in Congressman Scott, Robert C. Scott&#39;s office, Bobby Scott, from the Third District of Virginia. And it was very cool to see some of the great things they were doing to help shape young minds and future leaders. And I think that the caucus and the role of congressional leaders and just leadership in general requires you to look at ways to unite and to get your constituents and your communities that you touch, to look for ways to work together.\u00a0</p> <p>I mean, the goal of a congressperson is to take their district and help make it better. I know in recent years, we&#39;ve seen leadership go in the wrong direction. But these leaders have the opportunity to build bridges instead of tear them down. And so they can be the catalyst for change in their communities, they have the ability to direct resources and to direct attention, as well as to put their time on these topics. So they&#39;re already doing it by obviously relaunching the program and the caucus. And so the next step is then to empower their constituents to start these dialogues, start these conversations. And, and I think this gives them a reason, and also the organizations that they touch, a reason to start looking for ways to unite these communities.</p> <p>Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Excellent. So, you know, I want to take it a little more local, before we go back to the macro national level. Can you tell us more about your experience with Project Understanding? So for those that don&#39;t know, our listeners, AJC&#39;s Atlanta office has been running this, Marvin C. Goldstein Project Understanding Black Jewish retreat, every other year, since 1990-ish. We bring together 18 black and Jewish and some black-Jewish leaders to be a part of the conversation. So 36, in total. For 24 hours of intense dialogue. So I&#39;m wondering if you could tell us a little bit more about that experience for you. And if you&#39;ve been involved since then, beyond writing this book together, and I think Candace, you even referenced a new initiative that you&#39;re a part of, so I was wondering, if you could share a little bit more about that, too.</p> <p>Gabby Leon Spatt:</p> <p>Yes. So, you know, I mentioned earlier, the retreat was just eye opening, really moving. You know, I grew up, the granddaughter of Holocaust survivors, we were told, you always love everybody. The idea in my family of not liking somebody just because of their skin color, or their culture or their religion. It just didn&#39;t exist. And I don&#39;t know that I noticed, you know, growing up, I was already kind of doing some of this work.\u00a0</p> <p>And I had a mentor of mine in college, who was my Greek advisor. And we talked a lot about black and Jewish relations at the time, he asked me to make him, challah French toast because he always associated challah with Jewish. And I said, Sure. And I went to church with him, actually, here in Atlanta, we were here for a conference. And, you know, it just kind of happened authentically. And coming to Atlanta and getting connected with AJC, and the Black-Jewish Coalition. And then Project Understanding. I think I realized how powerful the experiences I had in the past were, and this just felt like home for me. And it&#39;s also, Dov, it&#39;s incredible to see how you&#39;ve invested more into the program and opened it up to a generation above, reaching 40 to 55 year olds, but also this year, launching a high school program. And so I think the impact of the retreat, that happens immediately, but also has a long lasting impact, we&#39;ve really been able to make change within the Atlanta community.</p> <p>Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Candace, how about for you?</p> <p>Candace Bazemore:</p> <p>Yeah. Well, you know, first of all, Gabby touched on all the things that are dear to my heart about, you know, what we&#39;ve learned along the way in our journey together. I kind of like listening to her talk about some of the programs were a part of. I mean, to see people from Project Understanding, the Black Jewish Coalition at events for the United Way or for the Junior League. I recently hosted a fundraiser for the Amario&#39;s Art Academy, which was a sneaker ball to help this, this program that helps young kids connect with arts and art opportunities that they wouldn&#39;t normally have, because they don&#39;t have the access to afford expensive art programs. And to have Gabby and her husband show up and have such a great time, and other people from other programs that were associated.</p> <p>So it&#39;s great to see how much the community building how it blends across everything that helps the community grow and be more diverse. And she even mentioned the the team program, through Project Understanding, it&#39;s the Black Jewish Teen Initiative is what it&#39;s called. So applications are open for this great program where the teens get to participate, they&#39;re high school juniors and seniors from across Greater Atlanta, coming together to learn about, black Jewish relationships, to learn about, like the impact of racism, antisemitism, to learn about diversity within the black and Jewish communities.</p> <p>So I mean, I&#39;m just super excited about some of the things that have come from these programs. And, and the fact that we&#39;re more forward thinking. So the idea of the book is a way to get in front of young minds, the idea of this program is to get in front of teen minds, the Project Understanding traditional program is for those emerging leaders. And now the new programs that are for people who maybe weren&#39;t around when these programs existed to instill, learn and build communities as they get older. We&#39;re looking at the whole life of people, how do you build relationships your whole life, so that those communities when you need them already there, you already know someone you can pick up the phone and say, Hey, how do I do this? What&#39;s the best way to do this? Or I made a mistake? How do I improve? How do I correct this? By having these relationships, there&#39;s more opportunity for grace. So, you know, gaps may happen, mistakes can happen. But if you have relationships, you have something that you can, dip into and say, Hey, how do we do things better? How do we do things differently?\u00a0</p> <p>Gabby Leon Spatt:</p> <p>I think it&#39;s also, you know, special to point out, we&#39;re one story, we\u2019re one outcome, right? There have been other individuals who have participated in Project understanding, who have started a barbecue team at the Atlanta Kosher BBQ Festival, which happens to be the largest kosher barbecue festival in the entire country. And that, you know, became a learning experience, just for themselves to be on the team, you had to go through Project Understanding, you know, and there&#39;s this cultural experience of explaining what kosher meat is. And you don&#39;t want to put extra salt in the rub, because it\u2019s already salted right. And when you like, the, you know, the barbecue, that has to be after Shabbat on sundown on Saturday, and the mashgiach has to light it. And then it&#39;s like, Who is that, right? And so the stuff that&#39;s happening in our community is so authentic, it just is happening, and it&#39;s so nice to see people just wanting to learn and continue the conversation past just the retreat.</p> <p>Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>I can also share that as an attendee of the BBQ Festival. It\u2019s not just that they&#39;re there together,they&#39;re grilling good meat. It&#39;s a very tasty experience to attend. Alright, so one final question. What are ways that we can highlight the positive worker interactions between our two communities?</p> <p>Candace Bazemore:</p> <p>Well, that&#39;s a great question. I always say the best way to highlight it is to ask people to share their individual stories. And me being a digital person, definitely utilize social media in order to get the word out about the ways that you know you&#39;re working together. If you&#39;re in a room with someone who doesn&#39;t look like you, and you&#39;re working on these tough problems and coming up with great solutions. share a post about that, encourage someone else to do that, too. If you have an event coming up, invite someone else out to come with it, that normally wouldn&#39;t be in the room. So I don&#39;t know how many times me and Gabby have been the only ones of us in a room before. A great example. I was in town during the great challah bake. And 300 Jewish women at the-was it at the Bernie Marcus center?\u00a0</p> <p>Gabby Leon Spatt:</p> <p>Yes, the Jewish Community Center.\u00a0</p> <p>Candace Bazemore:</p> <p>Jewish Community Center. Yeah. And so I was the only black woman or maybe one or two in the whole room?\u00a0</p> <p>Gabby Leon Spatt:</p> <p>It was just you.</p> <p>Candace Bazemore:</p> <p>It was just me, okay. And was having a good old time making some challah bread. Because challah\u2019s my thing. Obviously, Gabby has shown me how to make challah bread. So I&#39;m actually pretty good at it. She&#39;s getting good at deep fried cornbread as a matter of fact as well.\u00a0</p> <p>Gabby Leon Spatt:</p> <p>Oh it&#39;s so good. I think it&#39;s opportunities like this, being able to be invited to share your story. And I think the caucus is really going to highlight a lot of what is happening across the country already, and give, you know, local advocates on the ground doing the work the opportunity to shine and to tell their story, because I think more than anything, storytelling is impactful, and it hits, at people&#39;s hearts and people&#39;s minds, and in our case, people&#39;s stomachs.</p> <p>Dov Wilker:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Well, thank you, Gabby, and Candice, Candice and Gabby, we are so grateful for the book that you&#39;ve written for the delicious food, that you&#39;re helping to inspire being made across this beautiful country, and to your participation in the relaunch of the Congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish relations.\u00a0</p> <p>Candace Bazemore:</p> <p>Thank you.

Senior analyst Haviv Rettig Gur and news editor Amy Spiro join host Jacob Magid for Thursday's podcast. Spiro discusses NYT columnist Thomas Friedman's latest op-ed in which he claimed that the Biden administration has begun reassessing its relationship with the Netanyahu government, given the latter's \"extreme\" nature. The column received a lot of attention in both Israel and the US with officials from both governments quick to downplay the notion that times are a-changin', and Spiro helps put it all into perspective. Rettig Gur gives a sneak peek into a piece he is working on about how Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and opposition leaders Yair Lapid and Benny Gantz are struggling to gain support for their judicial overhaul stances beyond their respective bases. Rettig Gur lays out the dilemma: Neither side will succeed unless they cater to the roughly one-third of Israelis who prefer a more measured approach, but moving toward the political center would mean abandoning the more dominant ends of the political spectrum that are less interested in compromise. To close, Spiro discusses Hollywood superstar Helen Mirren's appearance Thursday evening at the Jerusalem Film Festival, where she will be receiving a reward for her performance in the biopic \"Golda,\" which premieres at the event.

His name is Daniel McGinn, and he\u2019s the author of Psyched Up: How the Science of Mental Preparation Can Help You Succeed. The first step to getting into an optimal mindset is managing negative emotions, so we begin our conversation with what works in mitigating stress and anxiety. From there we talk about how to get others psyched up with an effective pep talk and why the leaders who came out of WWII used the classic rah-rah style more than leaders do today. We then discuss the role of music in getting yourself psyched up and what Daniel learned from the DJ for the Red Sox about crafting the perfect pump-up playlist.

Keller-Lynn and Sharon discuss the passage of the first reading of the so-called reasonableness bill late Monday night and why it was chosen from the proposed judicial overhaul. Keller-Lynn reviews events that took place in the Knesset Monday, including the removal of protestors from the building and remarks made by opposition leaders Benny Gantz and Yair Lapid regarding the bill.

Zman Yisrael founding editor Biranit Goren and ToI's diplomatic correspondent Lazar Berman join host Jacob Magid for Monday's podcast. US President Joe Biden has shifted from criticizing the Israeli government's judicial overhaul plan to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's \"extremist\" government. Berman fills us in on what's behind the shift, what it means for Netanyahu's chances to score an invite to the White House and how it'll impact US efforts to broker a normalization deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Goren discusses a recent cabinet meeting, which ministers used as an opportunity to lay into Attorney General Gali Baharav Miara's handling of the judicial overhaul protests. Goren talks about the comparison government officials make between law enforcement's handling of today's protest and the demonstrations during the 2005 Gaza Disengagement and whether the juxtaposition is valid. She also fills us in on the anti-overhaul moves latest moves as the coalition readies to pass through a first reading later Monday legislation that would block courts from exercising judicial review over the \u201creasonableness\u201d of government decisions. Berman shares how President Isaac Herzog has decided to weigh in on a recent uptick in attacks by Jewish Orthodox extremists on Christians in Israel. He discusses the diplomatic ramifications of the trend and whether Israel is capable of addressing it. Finally, he lays out a recent interview Israel\u2019s Ambassador to Kyiv Michael Brodsky in which he criticized Ukraine's voting record against Israel at the United Nations. Berman reveals what was behind the frustration and speculates on whether Kyiv is likely to change course in light of the criticism. Discussed articles include: Biden: Israeli cabinet has some of most extreme members I\u2019ve seen; Saudi deal far off Ministers assail AG at cabinet meeting, demand protest crackdown, urge her removal Mall chain threatens strike if bill to curtail judicial oversight clears first vote Herzog condemns growing attacks on Christians as \u2018evil\u2019 and \u2018a disgrace\u2019 Ukraine\u2019s backing of 90% of UN anti-Israel votes could hurt support \u2014 Israeli envoy Subscribe to The Times of Israel Daily Briefing on\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify,\u00a0PlayerFM,\u00a0Google Play, or wherever you get your podcasts.

We discuss the brain\u2019s several reward systems involving dopamine and serotonin and how these motivate us to seek out specific behaviors and substances. We discuss how these reward systems are modified based on context and our memories, and how they can be hijacked toward maladaptive drug seeking in addiction. We also explore how reward systems influence social connections, oxytocin and empathy and how that applies to our understanding of autism spectrum disorders.

US bureau chief Jacob Magid and military correspondent Emmanuel Fabian join host Jessica Steinberg for today's podcast. Fabian opens with updates on the Tel Aviv car ramming and stabbing Tuesday afternoon with seven injured and the terrorist killed by an armed civilian. He reviews the end of the 44-hour Jenin operation that IDF says won't be the last, in which one Israeli soldier was killed, possibly by friendly fire, as troops were pulling out. Attention then turned to Gaza as rockets were launched toward the Israeli town of Sderot. Magid reflects on the reasons behind the Jenin operation, and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's change of tactics, not strategy, with brief incursion in order to take care of lack of Palestinian Authority control in Jenin. Steinberg speaks about the spate of international performers in Israel over the next few weeks, including this week's performances from UK's Morrissey, The Black Keys from the US in Israel next week and Christina Aguilera in early August. Magid also discusses the US Embassy July 4 party held at the Israel Museum, that was also a goodbye for US ambassador Tom Nides who is leaving his post after 19 months in the job. He notes that Netanyahu used the opportunity to reiterate Israel's friendship with the US, even as he plans a trip to China. Discussed articles include: 7 injured in ramming-stabbing attack in Tel Aviv; terrorist killed by armed civilian Soldier killed as massive Jenin operation winds down, all troops leave West Bank city Military begins withdrawing forces from Jenin after 44 hours of fighting Five rockets fired from Gaza at south, intercepted by Iron Dome \u2014 IDF PA freezes all ties with Israel over Jenin raid, as US urges closer cooperation Morrissey thrilled to be in \u2018God\u2019s country\u2019 as he performs first of two shows Netanyahu calls US Israel\u2019s \u2018irreplaceable ally\u2019 a week after announcing China trip Subscribe to The Times of Israel Daily Briefing on\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify,\u00a0PlayerFM,\u00a0Google Play, or wherever you get your podcasts.

Military correspondent Emanuel Fabian, diplomatic correspondent Lazar Berman and Knesset correspondent Carrie Keller-Lynn join host Amanda Borschel-Dan on today's episode. Israeli military forces launched a major operation in the West Bank city of Jenin early this morning. Large numbers of Israeli ground forces were seen entering tcity and refugee camp in an open-ended ground operation. Fabian talks about the stated goal of the operation, how long it's been in the works and what the forecast is so far. Berman discusses its potential diplomatic implications. Back in April, the Hezbollah terror group set up two tents set up in an area along the \u201cBlue Line\u201d between Lebanon and Israel, one of which was reportedly removed last night. What do these tents symbolize and how have they been kept out of the news? A massive day of anti-judicial overhaul protests is underway, with large-scale actions from Haifa in the north and on down. Keller-Lynn explains what is in store for us at Ben-Gurion Airport. On Thursday\u2019s Daily Briefing, Keller-Lynn discussed Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s interview with the Wall Street Journal and his statement that the override clause is off the table. But new reports seem to indicate otherwise. What is she hearing? And finally, Keller-Lynn explains last week's manoeuver to continue ultra-Orthodox army deferment -- even as the law that provides them expires. Discussed articles include: IDF strikes in Jenin, launches \u2018widescale effort against terror\u2019 in West Bank city Hezbollah said to evacuate one of the 2 tents it set up on Israeli side of Blue Line Overhaul critics seek show of force in afternoon protest at Ben Gurion Airport In U-turn, Netanyahu said to reassure ministers override clause has not been shelved Cabinet shields Haredi youth from military draft, 5 days before exemption law expiry Subscribe to The Times of Israel Daily Briefing on\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify,\u00a0PlayerFM,\u00a0Google Play, or wherever you get your podcasts.

Military correspondent Emanuel Fabian and US bureau chief Jacob Magid join host Amanda Borschel-Dan in today's episode. 17-year-old Nachman Mordoff, 17-year-old Elisha Anteman, 21-year-old Harel Masood and 64-year-old Ofer Fayerman were shot dead Tuesday afternoon near the West Bank settlement of Eli. Fabian takes us through what we know about the attack and its perpetrators. Following the attack, last night we saw a grim repeat of settler vandalization and violence in Palestinian locations near the settlement of Eli. What do we know so far about the damage wrought? Following the attack, US Ambassador to Israel Tom Nides issued two condemnations. Magid breaks down how the doubling up occurred. Magid learned yesterday that Morocco has decided to cancel plans to host the second ministerial gathering of the Negev Forum. What is the country's reasoning? This week the White House has issued condemnations against announcements of settlement expansions and reminders of the need for consensus for the judicial overhaul. Magid fills us in. And finally, we hear an update about the potential for direct flights from Israel to Saudi Arabia. Discussed articles include: Two teens, recently discharged soldier among 4 killed in West Bank attack Netanyahu: \u2018All options open\u2019 in responding to deadly West Bank shooting attack Rampaging settlers torch Palestinian cars, fields near Nablus after deadly shooting US envoy backpedals after tweet bemoaning West Bank deaths sparks Israeli protest Morocco cancels next month\u2019s Negev Forum over Israeli settlement announcements UN chief \u2018troubled, alarmed\u2019 by Israeli decisions to beef up settlement building US says overhaul consensus crucial as Netanyahu coalition unilaterally restarts push Flights between Israel and Saudi Arabia for Muslim pilgrims won\u2019t be ready for Hajj Subscribe to The Times of Israel Daily Briefing on\u00a0iTunes,\u00a0Spotify,\u00a0PlayerFM,\u00a0Google Play, or wherever you get your podcasts.

I discuss the neuronal mechanisms for how MDMA elevates mood, empathy, motivation, social engagement, and reduces \u201cthreat detection\u201d and how these effects can synergistically support talk therapy. I also explain the ongoing debate about the potential neurotoxicity of MDMA, myths about the origins and treatments for post-MDMA \u201ccrash,\u201d the evolving legal landscape around MDMA use for clinical purposes, and I caution recreational users about the extremely dangerous additives (e.g., fentanyl) now commonly found in black market MDMA.

Julie, the mic is yours. Julie Fishman Rayman: Thanks, Manya. It\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who represents the very diverse 8th congressional district of New York, in Brooklyn, and also serves as the Democratic Leader. He was unanimously elected to that position in November 2022, and in that capacity he is the highest ranking democrat in the US house. He is also the former chair of the democratic caucus, the whip of the congressional black caucus, and previously co-chaired the\u00a0 Democratic Policy and Communications committee. Also, a great friend of AJC and the Jewish community. Leader Jeffries, welcome to People of the Pod. Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Wonderful to be on. Thanks so much for having me. Julie Fishman Rayman: I want to get started by asking you about Jewish American Heritage Month, which as you know, we celebrate in May. Many listeners may not realize that members in congressional leadership cosponsor very few bills \u2013 meaning cosign or add their name to endorse them . In this Congress\u2013correct me if I\u2019m wrong\u2013you\u2019ve cosponsored fewer than a dozen bills and only one resolution\u2013the resolution commemorating Jewish American Heritage Month. Can you speak about this effort and why it was important to you to help lead it? Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0 Well, thank you so much. And that is absolutely correct. The tradition has been that members and leadership sponsor very few bills and even fewer resolutions, just because the enormity of the request is large. And you want to make sure that you're being very discerning in terms of what you want to elevate as a priority. And for me, it was incredibly important to make sure that I co sponsored the resolution that commemorated Jewish American Heritage Month for a variety of reasons, including the fact that I'm privileged to represent a district that has one of the largest Jewish communities in the country. In fact, I represent the ninth most African American district in the country, and the 16th most Jewish. And so I represent. As a good friend of mine, Leon Goldenberg, once and I quote, you've got the best of both worlds. It's an honor, though, to represent the reformed Jewish community, the conservative Jewish community, the Orthodox Jewish community, the modern Orthodox Jewish community, the ultra orthodox Jewish community, and more Russian speaking Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union than any other member of Congress in the country. I mean, Hakeem Jeffries, who knew only in America, but that's Brooklyn, that's New York City and the Jewish community has meant so much to the country, which is why we honor and celebrate and elevate Jewish American Heritage month but particularly has meant so much to the district that I'm privileged to represent to Brooklyn and to the great city of New York. Julie Fishman Rayman: The United States has many heritage months that celebrate the various communities that form the mosaic of our country, including Black History Month, Women\u2019s History Month, Hispanic Heritage Month, and more. By celebrating heritage months, we learn about one another, we honor the richness of our diverse nation, and we strengthen the fabric of American society. Some have described JAHM as going on the offensive against rising antisemitism, do you think that\u2019s an appropriate description? Amidst rising antisemitism and hate of all forms, does this change how we think about commemorative months?\u00a0 Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, it's a great question. I do think AJC's leadership and certainly the leadership of my former colleague, and good friend, Ted Deutsch has been phenomenally important in this area. And your leadership, Julie, of course, and this podcast and communicating information to the American people will continue to be critical. And the fact that the Jewish community is facing a shocking rise in anti semitism and hate crimes is a cause for alarm for all of us. And it does, I think, lead to the important conclusion that we need to rethink how we lean into the celebrations and acknowledgments, such as Jewish American Heritage Month. That is not just simply an opportunity to be able to communicate to the American people about the many accomplishments, the many ways in every field of human endeavor that Jewish Americans have contributed to the growth and development of America as we know it. And that is important, and that is appropriate. And that is a central part of what celebrating Jewish American Heritage Month should be all about.\u00a0 But it also provides a vehicle to make sure that the appropriate narrative is in the public domain in a compelling way, as a vehicle to push back against the rise in antisemitism and hate crimes. Because it's an all hands on deck approach. And it is going to require using every tool available to us. The rise in sort of hatred and extremism, and divisive, generally should trouble us all throughout America over the last several years, and particularly, the sharp and dramatic rise, particularly given the history of the Jewish community, over 1000s of years of persecutions, and pogroms and pain and suffering, should alarm us all. And it is exactly the reason why thinking about this month as one of the tools that we can use to push back aggressively against the rise and hatred is an important and appropriate approach. Julie Fishman Rayman: In April, during your first congressional delegation trip as Leader, you traveled to Israel. You have been a great supporter, supporting Israel\u2019s right to defense and speaking out against anti-Israel sentiment time and time again. What were your biggest takeaways from this mission? What are the major challenges and opportunities for the U.S.-Israel relationship? Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0 Well, that was my sixth time traveling to Israel, fifth time as a member of Congress. And the first time that I traveled to Israel, I actually was a freshman member of the New York State Legislature as part of a trip sponsored by the JCRC of New York, a wonderful opportunity. Someone said to me recently, Julie, wait, wait. You've been to Israel six times. I said, Yes. That's more than any other country you've been to in the world. I said, That would be correct. Is it isn't that a lot? I said, No, not at all. First of all, I'm from New York City, where we consider Jerusalem to be the sixth borough. And I'm just trying to catch up to my constituents. Every time I go to Israel, it's a wonderful eye opening experience. This particular trip was meaningful to me in that I was able to actually lead a delegation for the first time in this position and choose where I would go to in the world as part of my first congressional trip on foreign soil, as the House Democratic Leader. And I chose to go to Israel and to Ghana, to incredibly meaningful countries to meet personally, to the people that I represent, and, of course, to the relationship that exists between the United States and Israel. And I wanted to do it so that it was timed to the anniversary of the 75th founding of the State of Israel, because I thought that will be meaningful for the members that agreed to travel with me and certainly meaningful to me to say to the world, that we're going to continue, as we've transitioned leadership in the House of Representatives, to stand behind the special relationship between the United States and Israel. And to make it clear that that's a special relationship that we as House Democrats believe, is anchored in our shared values and our shared strategic interests. And it was incredible because of the timing of we were there, both on the day of remembrance was incredibly moving. And I was able to participate in one of the ceremonies that we're held to acknowledge those who have been lost, both to acts of terror, and in the conflicts that Israel has been made to endure throughout the 75 year history. And then, of course, on the eve of the celebration connected to the 75th anniversary, and we had a very diverse group of members, several prominent Jewish American members of Congress, of course, like Josh Gottheimer and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Dean Phillips, Sarah Jacobs, who was a new and emerging leader, but also the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. Steve Horsford, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Nanette Barragan, the first vice chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Yvette Clarke, as well as the top Democrat on the foreign affairs committee, Greg Meeks. And so it was a wonderful experience. We had important public policy discussions with Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Herzog, with the Speaker of the Knesset, as well as the opposition leader, Lapid, they were open, they were honest, there were candid discussions about the challenges that our two countries face. But it was all anchored in our clear affirmation of Israel's right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state, and our commitment as House Democrats to continue to lift up and elevate the special relationship between our two countries. Julie Fishman Rayman: So important. How's Israel doing at 75? Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I think Israel, it's a miracle, as has been described, that we've gotten to 75 years. And it's a testament to the strength, and the resilience and the ability, the heart, the soul, the love the intellect, of the Jewish people, and the people of the State of Israel. And I'm confident that through the challenges that we all face in Israel, the best is yet to come. You had an interesting discussion, because of the judicial reform, issues that are underway. And we've got challenges that we're working through here in the United States of America, certainly, as it relates to the Supreme Court, and what is the right, you know, balance in terms of our three branches of government. And we've got to work through that here. Many of us have been troubled by recent developments coming out of the Supreme Court, and Israel's working through trying to figure out what that right balance is, in terms of the rule of law, and the independence of the judiciary, and how that works together. I think what has been clear to me, in terms of Israel as a robust democracy, that will continue to be a robust democracy is not the challenge is that it's working through to find common ground. And those talks are being led, of course, by President Herzog. But most significantly, the fact that hundreds of 1000s of Israelis have been in the streets, exercising their right, their freedom of expression, their freedom of speech, their freedom of assembly, the right to peaceably gather and petition your government that is at the hallmark of a democratic society. And that's what we've seen, and not a single shot fired, probably nowhere else in the Middle East, would that have occurred other than in Israel, and it's an affirmation of Israel's democratic character. Julie Fishman Rayman: In just a few weeks, AJC will hold our annual Global Forum in Tel Aviv. What is one piece of advice you\u2019d give the 1000 or so people coming from around the world to Israel at this time? Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0 Well, I do think that every time I've gone to Israel, what has been a wonderful aspect of the trip was talking to the full range of people in Israeli society, to get the perspectives on the ground in terms of their views related to the challenges that Israel confront, and the opportunities that exists to continue to thrive into the future. And those are particularly relevant conversations to have now that Israel has hit this incredible milestone of 75 years in what still remains one of the toughest, if not the toughest neighborhoods in the world. And one of the reasons why sustained dialogue, sustained opportunity to engage in wonderful that AJC is hosting this forum in the next month, is that the challenges are always unique whenever one arrives in Israel. You know, it could be Hamas, it could be Hezbollah, it could be uncertainty in terms of the Iranian malign activity in Syria. It's always, you know, Iran's efforts to try to secure a nuclear weapon and we're gonna make sure that Iran never becomes nuclear capable in Gaza. There are different moments in time, where particular concern meets a level of urgency, but it's always consistently within the frame of Israel living in a very tough neighborhood, which is what I, you know, we reiterated as House Democrats directly to Prime Minister Netanyahu, our commitment to ensuring Israel maintains its qualitative military edge. My view on this thing has always been, and I grew up in central Brooklyn, came of age in the mid to late 80s, early 90s. I kind of know from tough neighborhoods. That was a tough neighborhood. I grew up in Israel, Hamas, Hezbollah, Gaza, chaos in Syria, in Iraq, Iran with nuclear aspirations, dangerous situation in the Sinai. That's a tough neighborhood. And in a tough neighborhood. The one constant, as I've consistently said, is strength. You can achieve peace, you can achieve stability, but you can only achieve it through the lens of strength. And I think, part of the dialogue that we all should continue to have and will be important for AJC to continue to have is, you know, what are the severe threats that Israel currently confronts? And how can we continue to ensure that Israel has the strength to defend itself and to provide a foundation for lasting peace moving forward building upon things like the Abraham accords? Julie Fishman Rayman:\u00a0 Prior to Israel, you and the members of congress who traveled with you to Israel went to Ghana, one of America\u2019s closest allies in West Africa and a nation that still bears the painful scars of the transatlantic slave trade. At AJC\u2019s 2019 Global Forum, you became the first member of the congressional Caucus on Black-Jewish Relations, I think less than an hour after it was officially launched. Did your back to back trips to Ghana and then Israel spark any insights as we continue\u2013collectively\u2013to try to bring Blacks and Jews closer together? Especially because Blacks and Jews were really strongly represented in your delegation? Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, you know, AJC's effort in terms of forming the black Jewish caucus was a wonderful thing, a great foundation. And in many ways, the trip to Ghana and to Israel is in that same tradition. And as you pointed out, Julie, there were a lot of African American members of Congress who on the trip and a lot of Jewish men from the members of Congress who were on the trip who visited both countries. And, you know, we were able to involve Ghana, and in Israel and Ghana, visit the Cape Coast slave castles, which were central to the horrific transatlantic slave trade. And we also were able to visit Yad Vashem and I was able to lay a wreath and make it clear that we would never forget and never again, allow the Horus of what was seen during the Holocaust to occur. And it was important that in addition to, in Ghana, for instance, meeting with President Akufo Addo, to visit the site, for a lot of the activity of the transatlantic slave trade, and, of course, the ties that then connect to the African American community in the United States of America, and to visit the door of no return. But also to make sure that, in the time that we were in Israel, almost every time that I've been there, we've always made it a point to make sure that we visited Yad Vashem, it's always a very powerful, moving experience. And it was the same and to be able to do it together with black members of Congress and Jewish members of Congress, and leaders, who were not black and Jewish, but were on the trip with us, was really a powerful experience, I think, for everyone involved. And I think it's important for us to continue to try to lean in to strengthening the relationships between the black and Jewish community. It's something that because of the district that I represent, has always been central to my time and public service. And I do you know, I am moved by the fact that at least part of the district that I represent, and that told this story during the Democratic caucus celebration of Jewish American Heritage Month, but I tried to tell it whenever I get the opportunity that I do represent a district that was once represented in part by a manual seller. And a manual seller was the longest certain Congress person in the history of the country. He served for 50 years, first elected in 1922. And served through 1972.\u00a0 He was a staunch ally and advocate for the special relationship between the United States and Israel from the very beginning. He was there, I believe, with Truman, when the United States first recognized Israel, and was there to support the special relationship every step of the way throughout the time that he was in Congress. But what also is little known about Manny seller, as he was affectionately known in Brooklyn, is that during the 1960s, he was also the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, which meant that he played an important role, legislatively, and making sure that the 1964 Civil Rights Act, and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, became the law of the land, to crush Jim Crow, and crushed the effort to oppress the ability of African Americans, particularly in the south to participate fully in our democracy. And then you go to civil rights museums across the country, and whenever there have been exhibits, even here in the Library of Congress, usually always an acknowledgement of the role that Manny Celler played. And I'm proud of the fact that I can represent a district that someone who was such an important link between the black and Jewish community and actually played a meaningful role in helping to advance legislation to change the course of America, in supporting the efforts and leadership of Dr. King and others, is an important thing.\u00a0 That's a tradition that I look forward to continuing to build upon and at the same time, to be able to represent a district as I mentioned earlier, where I serve more Russian speaking Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union than anyone else. And to know that Dr. King took time out from his days of leading the civil rights movement, to speak to Jewish leaders and rabbinical leaders across the country famously anchored in his guiding principle, that injustice anywhere is a justice everywhere, and it was great injustice, being directed at the Jewish community that was behind the Iron Curtain during the days of the Soviet Union, and to use his voice to speak up on behalf of what he appropriately viewed as his Jewish brothers and sisters who are facing oppression. That example that was set by Dr. King, that example that was set by Congressman Judiciary Committee Chair Manny Celler, who wasn't just focused on strengthening the relationship between the United States and Israel, but also dealt with the injustices directed at African Americans throughout the United States. That's a powerful heritage for us in Congress, or us as leaders, as AJC has promoted, to continue to build upon. Julie Fishman Rayman: Thank you so much, you've provided us with such a sweeping understanding not just of the history-everything from Manny Celler to Dr. King to Yad Vashem. But also a vision for where we can all go collectively. Whether it's in May, during Jewish American Heritage Month, or Black History Month, or every day, trying to honor the legacy of Americans from all facets who lift up our great nation and make it what it is today. Leader Jeffries, thank you for your leadership and thank you for being with us. Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you so much, what an honor Julie to be on and all the best to you and look forward to continuing to work closely with Ted, with AJC, on behalf of the issues that we all care about, particularly as it relates to the well being of the Jewish community here in the United States of America and throughout the world.

Julie, the mic is yours.</p> <p>Julie Fishman Rayman:</p> <p>Thanks, Manya. It\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, who represents the very diverse 8th congressional district of New York, in Brooklyn, and also serves as the Democratic Leader. He was unanimously elected to that position in November 2022, and in that capacity he is the highest ranking democrat in the US house. He is also the former chair of the democratic caucus, the whip of the congressional black caucus, and previously co-chaired the\u00a0 Democratic Policy and Communications committee. Also, a great friend of AJC and the Jewish community. Leader Jeffries, welcome to People of the Pod.</p> <p>Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Wonderful to be on. Thanks so much for having me.</p> <p>Julie Fishman Rayman:</p> <p>I want to get started by asking you about Jewish American Heritage Month, which as you know, we celebrate in May. Many listeners may not realize that members in congressional leadership cosponsor very few bills \u2013 meaning cosign or add their name to endorse them . In this Congress\u2013correct me if I\u2019m wrong\u2013you\u2019ve cosponsored fewer than a dozen bills and only one resolution\u2013the resolution commemorating Jewish American Heritage Month. Can you speak about this effort and why it was important to you to help lead it?</p> <p>Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Well, thank you so much. And that is absolutely correct. The tradition has been that members and leadership sponsor very few bills and even fewer resolutions, just because the enormity of the request is large. And you want to make sure that you&#39;re being very discerning in terms of what you want to elevate as a priority. And for me, it was incredibly important to make sure that I co sponsored the resolution that commemorated Jewish American Heritage Month for a variety of reasons, including the fact that I&#39;m privileged to represent a district that has one of the largest Jewish communities in the country. In fact, I represent the ninth most African American district in the country, and the 16th most Jewish. And so I represent. As a good friend of mine, Leon Goldenberg, once and I quote, you&#39;ve got the best of both worlds.</p> <p>It&#39;s an honor, though, to represent the reformed Jewish community, the conservative Jewish community, the Orthodox Jewish community, the modern Orthodox Jewish community, the ultra orthodox Jewish community, and more Russian speaking Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union than any other member of Congress in the country. I mean, Hakeem Jeffries, who knew only in America, but that&#39;s Brooklyn, that&#39;s New York City and the Jewish community has meant so much to the country, which is why we honor and celebrate and elevate Jewish American Heritage month but particularly has meant so much to the district that I&#39;m privileged to represent to Brooklyn and to the great city of New York.</p> <p>Julie Fishman Rayman:</p> <p>The United States has many heritage months that celebrate the various communities that form the mosaic of our country, including Black History Month, Women\u2019s History Month, Hispanic Heritage Month, and more. By celebrating heritage months, we learn about one another, we honor the richness of our diverse nation, and we strengthen the fabric of American society. Some have described JAHM as going on the offensive against rising antisemitism, do you think that\u2019s an appropriate description? Amidst rising antisemitism and hate of all forms, does this change how we think about commemorative months?\u00a0</p> <p>Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Yes, it&#39;s a great question. I do think AJC&#39;s leadership and certainly the leadership of my former colleague, and good friend, Ted Deutsch has been phenomenally important in this area. And your leadership, Julie, of course, and this podcast and communicating information to the American people will continue to be critical. And the fact that the Jewish community is facing a shocking rise in anti semitism and hate crimes is a cause for alarm for all of us. And it does, I think, lead to the important conclusion that we need to rethink how we lean into the celebrations and acknowledgments, such as Jewish American Heritage Month. That is not just simply an opportunity to be able to communicate to the American people about the many accomplishments, the many ways in every field of human endeavor that Jewish Americans have contributed to the growth and development of America as we know it. And that is important, and that is appropriate. And that is a central part of what celebrating Jewish American Heritage Month should be all about.\u00a0</p> <p>But it also provides a vehicle to make sure that the appropriate narrative is in the public domain in a compelling way, as a vehicle to push back against the rise in antisemitism and hate crimes. Because it&#39;s an all hands on deck approach. And it is going to require using every tool available to us. The rise in sort of hatred and extremism, and divisive, generally should trouble us all throughout America over the last several years, and particularly, the sharp and dramatic rise, particularly given the history of the Jewish community, over 1000s of years of persecutions, and pogroms and pain and suffering, should alarm us all. And it is exactly the reason why thinking about this month as one of the tools that we can use to push back aggressively against the rise and hatred is an important and appropriate approach.</p> <p>Julie Fishman Rayman:</p> <p>In April, during your first congressional delegation trip as Leader, you traveled to Israel. You have been a great supporter, supporting Israel\u2019s right to defense and speaking out against anti-Israel sentiment time and time again. What were your biggest takeaways from this mission? What are the major challenges and opportunities for the U.S.-Israel relationship?</p> <p>Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Well, that was my sixth time traveling to Israel, fifth time as a member of Congress. And the first time that I traveled to Israel, I actually was a freshman member of the New York State Legislature as part of a trip sponsored by the JCRC of New York, a wonderful opportunity. Someone said to me recently, Julie, wait, wait. You&#39;ve been to Israel six times. I said, Yes. That&#39;s more than any other country you&#39;ve been to in the world. I said, That would be correct. Is it isn&#39;t that a lot? I said, No, not at all. First of all, I&#39;m from New York City, where we consider Jerusalem to be the sixth borough. And I&#39;m just trying to catch up to my constituents. Every time I go to Israel, it&#39;s a wonderful eye opening experience. This particular trip was meaningful to me in that I was able to actually lead a delegation for the first time in this position and choose where I would go to in the world as part of my first congressional trip on foreign soil, as the House Democratic Leader. And I chose to go to Israel and to Ghana, to incredibly meaningful countries to meet personally, to the people that I represent, and, of course, to the relationship that exists between the United States and Israel. And I wanted to do it so that it was timed to the anniversary of the 75th founding of the State of Israel, because I thought that will be meaningful for the members that agreed to travel with me and certainly meaningful to me to say to the world, that we&#39;re going to continue, as we&#39;ve transitioned leadership in the House of Representatives, to stand behind the special relationship between the United States and Israel. And to make it clear that that&#39;s a special relationship that we as House Democrats believe, is anchored in our shared values and our shared strategic interests. And it was incredible because of the timing of we were there, both on the day of remembrance was incredibly moving. And I was able to participate in one of the ceremonies that we&#39;re held to acknowledge those who have been lost, both to acts of terror, and in the conflicts that Israel has been made to endure throughout the 75 year history.</p> <p>And then, of course, on the eve of the celebration connected to the 75th anniversary, and we had a very diverse group of members, several prominent Jewish American members of Congress, of course, like Josh Gottheimer and Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Dean Phillips, Sarah Jacobs, who was a new and emerging leader, but also the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. Steve Horsford, the chair of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, Nanette Barragan, the first vice chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, Yvette Clarke, as well as the top Democrat on the foreign affairs committee, Greg Meeks. And so it was a wonderful experience. We had important public policy discussions with Prime Minister Netanyahu, President Herzog, with the Speaker of the Knesset, as well as the opposition leader, Lapid, they were open, they were honest, there were candid discussions about the challenges that our two countries face. But it was all anchored in our clear affirmation of Israel&#39;s right to exist as a Jewish and democratic state, and our commitment as House Democrats to continue to lift up and elevate the special relationship between our two countries.</p> <p>Julie Fishman Rayman:</p> <p>So important. How&#39;s Israel doing at 75?</p> <p>Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>I think Israel, it&#39;s a miracle, as has been described, that we&#39;ve gotten to 75 years. And it&#39;s a testament to the strength, and the resilience and the ability, the heart, the soul, the love the intellect, of the Jewish people, and the people of the State of Israel. And I&#39;m confident that through the challenges that we all face in Israel, the best is yet to come. You had an interesting discussion, because of the judicial reform, issues that are underway. And we&#39;ve got challenges that we&#39;re working through here in the United States of America, certainly, as it relates to the Supreme Court, and what is the right, you know, balance in terms of our three branches of government. And we&#39;ve got to work through that here. Many of us have been troubled by recent developments coming out of the Supreme Court, and Israel&#39;s working through trying to figure out what that right balance is, in terms of the rule of law, and the independence of the judiciary, and how that works together.</p> <p>I think what has been clear to me, in terms of Israel as a robust democracy, that will continue to be a robust democracy is not the challenge is that it&#39;s working through to find common ground. And those talks are being led, of course, by President Herzog. But most significantly, the fact that hundreds of 1000s of Israelis have been in the streets, exercising their right, their freedom of expression, their freedom of speech, their freedom of assembly, the right to peaceably gather and petition your government that is at the hallmark of a democratic society. And that&#39;s what we&#39;ve seen, and not a single shot fired, probably nowhere else in the Middle East, would that have occurred other than in Israel, and it&#39;s an affirmation of Israel&#39;s democratic character.</p> <p>Julie Fishman Rayman:</p> <p>In just a few weeks, AJC will hold our annual Global Forum in Tel Aviv. What is one piece of advice you\u2019d give the 1000 or so people coming from around the world to Israel at this time?</p> <p>Hakeem Jeffries:\u00a0\u00a0</p> <p>Well, I do think that every time I&#39;ve gone to Israel, what has been a wonderful aspect of the trip was talking to the full range of people in Israeli society, to get the perspectives on the ground in terms of their views related to the challenges that Israel confront, and the opportunities that exists to continue to thrive into the future. And those are particularly relevant conversations to have now that Israel has hit this incredible milestone of 75 years in what still remains one of the toughest, if not the toughest neighborhoods in the world. And one of the reasons why sustained dialogue, sustained opportunity to engage in wonderful that AJC is hosting this forum in the next month, is that the challenges are always unique whenever one arrives in Israel.</p> <p>You know, it could be Hamas, it could be Hezbollah, it could be uncertainty in terms of the Iranian malign activity in Syria. It&#39;s always, you know, Iran&#39;s efforts to try to secure a nuclear weapon and we&#39;re gonna make sure that Iran never becomes nuclear capable in Gaza. There are different moments in time, where particular concern meets a level of urgency, but it&#39;s always consistently within the frame of Israel living in a very tough neighborhood, which is what I, you know, we reiterated as House Democrats directly to Prime Minister Netanyahu, our commitment to ensuring Israel maintains its qualitative military edge. My view on this thing has always been, and I grew up in central Brooklyn, came of age in the mid to late 80s, early 90s. I kind of know from tough neighborhoods. That was a tough neighborhood. I grew up in Israel, Hamas, Hezbollah, Gaza, chaos in Syria, in Iraq, Iran with nuclear aspirations, dangerous situation in the Sinai. That&#39;s a tough neighborhood. And in a tough neighborhood. The one constant, as I&#39;ve consistently said, is strength. You can achieve peace, you can achieve stability, but you can only achieve it through the lens of strength. And I think, part of the dialogue that we all should continue to have and will be important for AJC to continue to have is, you know, what are the severe threats that Israel currently confronts? And how can we continue to ensure that Israel has the strength to defend itself and to provide a foundation for lasting peace moving forward building upon things like the Abraham accords?</p> <p>Julie Fishman Rayman:\u00a0</p> <p>Prior to Israel, you and the members of congress who traveled with you to Israel went to Ghana, one of America\u2019s closest allies in West Africa and a nation that still bears the painful scars of the transatlantic slave trade.

He is the youngest member of the Senate elected since 1980. The first millennial in fact. He's also the first Jewish member of the Senate from Georgia. In fact, the first Jewish Senator from the deep south since 1878. Senator Ossoff joins us now in honor of Jewish American Heritage Month. Senator, welcome to People of the Pod. Jon Ossoff: Manya, thank you so much for the invitation. It's an honor to be here.\u00a0 Manya Brachear Pashman: So, Israel just celebrated its 75th birthday. It's a young country, but it's twice as old as you. You are 36, I believe. How do you relate to that historic milestone, as someone who's Jewish, who\u2019s a father, as a Senator who knows Israel's strategic importance to the United States? How do you relate to Israel? Jon Ossoff: Well, I think I should begin with a reflection on how my family's story has influenced me and influenced how I think about US-Israel relations. I was sworn in to the Senate, and in my jacket pocket at that moment, had the ship's manifests, documenting the arrival of my great grandparents, Annie and Israel, at Ellis Island, from Eastern Europe, in 1911 and 1913. And they left Eastern Europe in the early 20th century, as so many European Jews did, fleeing antisemitism. And while many members of my family and ancestors managed to escape, as in so many Jewish families, there were many who did not. And of those who did not, to my knowledge, all but one perished in the Holocaust. And I remember as a very young child, spending time with my uncle Nate, I called him uncle Nate. He had escaped, and hidden in the forests around the camp and the worksite, until he was liberated.\u00a0 And I remember as a young child sitting with him and tracing with my finger, the numbers tattooed into his arm. And I think so many American Jews have experiences like that one, having grown up among Holocaust survivors. And growing up among survivors, and being keenly aware of the genocide of Jews, the attempt with industrial-scale brutality to extinguish the Jewish people forever, has a profound impact on all Jews, all Jews in the United States, all Jews around the world.\u00a0 And of course, it has a profound impact on how I view the State of Israel, recognizing that the State of Israel was established 75 years ago as Jews rebuilt in the ashes of the Holocaust, and sought to establish a secure homeland for the Jewish people.\u00a0 I am now, as many American Jews are, deeply concerned about Israel's future, deeply concerned about the trends and dynamics and risks in the broader Middle East. And as an American policymaker, of course, particularly focused on US national security interests and other interests in the region. So I have worked for the last couple of years, to build strong working relationships, on a foundation of trust with regional leaders in Israel, in neighboring and surrounding countries, and in the Palestinian Authority, so that I can play a constructive role advancing US interests, and working to ensure that Israel can survive as a democracy and a secure homeland for the Jewish people. And also that all people in this region can one day flourish in peace and security and freedom. Manya Brachear Pashman: Do you believe that your colleagues share that understanding of the importance of Israel, the importance of Israel to the Jewish people. And as a follow up to that, you know, we deal a lot with combating and fighting antisemitism. How much of today's antisemitism is kind of disguised as anti-Israel criticism, and has to do with a lack of understanding of the role of Israel? Jon Ossoff: Look, I think that these things can and sometimes do overlap. And I think we also have to be clear that in our free society, and as we as free citizens discuss the state of the world, we also have to avoid dismissing any critical views of Israeli policy as mere antisemitism, because there are many principled people who have a diversity of views about the Middle East region, who hold those views in good faith, not born of any kind of religious hatred.\u00a0 You know, as for my colleagues in the Senate, I do believe that there is a growing and strong awareness of the rising tide and threat of antisemitism at this moment here in the United States, and around the world. In Georgia, just recently, there have been multiple incidents of hateful antisemitic literature being littered in the yards and driveways of Jews in different communities across the state. We've seen, of course, a significant increase in hate crimes, violent threats, and acts of violence, targeting Jews.\u00a0 And I was speaking recently at a Yom Hashoah event at a cemetery in Atlanta. It's an annual event that I attend, the Israeli Consul General typically attends, and local Jewish community leaders. And I heard a baby crying during the ceremony. And when I made my remarks, and as a father, my wife, Alicia, and I have an 18 month old baby daughter at home. I shared with the crowd how to me and I think to all of us how profound it was to hear a baby crying at an event remembering the unfathomable loss of the Holocaust, because that baby's voice is proof that the effort to destroy the Jewish people failed, and that we survived and that we persist.\u00a0 But that Jewish child is also growing up at a time when antisemitism continues to grow as a threat to Jews in the United States and around the world, which requires us to be vigilant and determined, informed by our people's history. That threats to Jews have not been permanently defeated. As they have throughout history, they rise and rise again and we have to be ever vigilant. Manya Brachear Pashman: You have confronted antisemitism in the past, some very classic conspiracy theories. I'm curious how you confront that personally. And what government's role is in combating antisemitism? Jon Ossoff: There was the widely covered, widely condemned incident during my Senate campaign. When my opponent\u2019s campaign doctored an image of my face to lengthen my nose, portray me as the sort of classic caricature, antisemitic caricature. And look, of course, as a public figure, some of the hate and ill will and sometimes threats that come my way have within them or are motivated by hatred of Jews and antisemitism.\u00a0 You know, I think as a public figure Manya, I have had to build the armor, personally necessary to protect myself and my family, to weather threats and insults that come with public life and leadership in the public arena. But for those who have not chosen a life in the public eye, you know, the swastika spray painted on the garage door, the hateful pamphlet dropped in the driveway, the threatening anonymous voicemail. You know, it's more than just upsetting and disturbing. It represents a threat to a family's safety. It represents a threat to children, to life, to property, and it undermines and can destroy the trust that we have, that our communities are open and tolerant, and based upon love and acceptance of one another, regardless of our faith. So it's a deeply worrying and corrosive and threatening dynamic in our society right now. Manya Brachear Pashman: So, should Jewish families build a similar armor, similar to what you have developed as a public figure? Or does the government have a role in doing something to combat it? Jon Ossoff: Private citizens should not have to weather and endure and be subjected to hatred and harassment and bigotry. And there is a role for leaders in government. I work alongside my colleague, Senator Jackie Rosen of Nevada, on the bipartisan Joint Task Force on Antisemitism to develop solutions within Congress.\u00a0 But at this moment of increased hatred, and violence, and division along all kinds of lines in our society: religious, racial, ethnic, political, cultural, all of us, leaders and citizens, are called upon to promote and defend and strengthen the loving and trusting and tolerant bonds between neighbors and fellow citizens to make our society more resilient to the fringe, which promotes hatred, and to ensure that the United States lives up to its highest ideals as a place where, regardless of where one came from, or how one worships one can be free and safe and treated with dignity. Manya Brachear Pashman: In fact, you called for a federal task force, an inter-agency Task Force to address Antisemitism back in December. That task force has become a reality. And I'm curious if you feel like that task force should be working toward more of a civil society response or actual government agencies, policies to really curb the spread of antisemitism? Or maybe it's a combination of both. Jon Ossoff: Look, I think that there is clearly a role for leaders in government and elected officials to promote and strengthen policies and ideals that defend the public against hate crimes, against violence, against harassment. And this also has to be a broader effort shared by leaders in all fields, business leaders, faith leaders, civic leaders, community leaders, and every ordinary citizen.\u00a0 The reality is that despite how hateful and divided the public discourse can seem, and is, and despite the alarming and dangerous rise in antisemitism, and various forms of hatred, most people are deeply good. Most people are kind. Most people cherish the American ideals of equal justice, freedom of religion, and the basic idea that this is a place where people from all kinds of family backgrounds coexist and live together as Americans not on the basis of one religious creed or racial identity or national origin, but on the basis of commitment to our country's fundamental values. And I think we all have a role to play in defending and lifting up that vision of our society at a time when there is so much hate in the political and cultural and social discussion. Manya Brachear Pashman: You interned in high school for the late Congressman John Lewis of blessed memory, a longtime dear friend of AJC. What is the direction of the relationship between black and Jewish communities in America? Where are the points of tension, the points of promising engagement? Where do we go from here? Jon Ossoff: You know, sort of an extraordinary 24 hours in Georgia\u2019s history and US History: January 5, to January 6, of 2021. On January 5, the state of Georgia, and you know, our complex history, as both the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement and the heart of the Old Confederacy, elected to the US Senate, the 33 year old Jewish son of an immigrant, and a black pastor, who holds the same pulpit that Dr. King did at Ebenezer Baptist Church. The first black senator in Georgia's history, the first Jewish Senator in Georgia's history, the first Jew elected to the Senate from the deep south since 1878.\u00a0 And that is a powerful testament to what I was describing earlier that, you know, despite the level of hatred and division that we see in our public life, this country has come so far in terms of tolerance. But it wasn't 12 hours later, that the US Capitol was being ransacked by a hateful and violent mob. In some cases, sporting neo-Nazi and Confederate symbols, who tried to use violence, to prevent the peaceful transfer of power in our democracy, a core process in our constitutional system.\u00a0 And so while what happened on January 5 demonstrated how far we have come, what happened the next day demonstrated the reality of the very real and present threat to those values. I mentioned that I was sworn in with, in my jacket pocket, the ship's manifests documenting my great grandparents' arrivals at Ellis Island. 2 I was also sworn in on the Tanach that had belonged to Rabbi Jacob Rothschild, who had been the longtime rabbi at the temple, the Atlanta synagogue that I attended growing up, and where I was Bar Mitzvahed. And the temple in 1958 was bombed by the Klan in retaliation for Rabbi Rothschild\u2019s alliance with Dr. King and his denunciation of segregation. And I was sworn in on that Tanach because, of course of the special role that that synagogue had played in my upbringing, but also because of the values that it represented as a possession of Rabbi Rothschild\u2019s at the moment when Senator Warnock and I had been elected.\u00a0 And since Congressman Lewis had been a key mentor in my life, and I, so well recall that one of the first things he ever explained to me in great detail, when we sat down together, was the historic alliance between blacks and Jews in the civil rights movement, how he had marched alongside rabbis and Jews who had come to the south in the Freedom Summer to demand civil rights and voting rights. And, you know, that's a legacy of solidarity between two peoples who have had very different, but both long-term struggles against hatred, genocide. And I think it's a bond that needs to be nourished and strengthened. Manya Brachear Pashman: Do you see obstacles in the way of that? Jon Ossoff: Look in Georgia, the Jewish and black communities love one another, work closely together. And there is always room for growth. And so Manya in closing, I have to run in vote on the floor of the Senate in just a moment. I just want to, if I might, take this opportunity to reiterate what I said earlier, but at a moment like this, when there is hatred and violence, threatening and in the air, and on the ground, in reality. And when Jewish families and many American families of various minority backgrounds feel threatened by the rise in hate crimes, and religious, racial, ethnic, and cultural hatred, it's our shared obligation to make real a country that lives up to America's highest ideals.\u00a0 And I believe that we can, and we will, by pulling together and believing in that and working together to defend what's best about the United States. I really appreciate the opportunity to spend some time with you. And thank you for the work you do, getting information out there and connecting Jews across the country through this podcast.\u00a0 Manya Brachear Pashman: Wonderful. Thank you so much, Senator.

He is the youngest member of the Senate elected since 1980. The first millennial in fact. He&#39;s also the first Jewish member of the Senate from Georgia. In fact, the first Jewish Senator from the deep south since 1878. Senator Ossoff joins us now in honor of Jewish American Heritage Month. Senator, welcome to People of the Pod.</p> <p>Jon Ossoff:</p> <p>Manya, thank you so much for the invitation. It&#39;s an honor to be here.\u00a0</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman:</p> <p>So, Israel just celebrated its 75th birthday. It&#39;s a young country, but it&#39;s twice as old as you. You are 36, I believe. How do you relate to that historic milestone, as someone who&#39;s Jewish, who\u2019s a father, as a Senator who knows Israel&#39;s strategic importance to the United States? How do you relate to Israel?</p> <p>Jon Ossoff:</p> <p>Well, I think I should begin with a reflection on how my family&#39;s story has influenced me and influenced how I think about US-Israel relations. I was sworn in to the Senate, and in my jacket pocket at that moment, had the ship&#39;s manifests, documenting the arrival of my great grandparents, Annie and Israel, at Ellis Island, from Eastern Europe, in 1911 and 1913. And they left Eastern Europe in the early 20th century, as so many European Jews did, fleeing antisemitism. And while many members of my family and ancestors managed to escape, as in so many Jewish families, there were many who did not. And of those who did not, to my knowledge, all but one perished in the Holocaust. And I remember as a very young child, spending time with my uncle Nate, I called him uncle Nate. He had escaped, and hidden in the forests around the camp and the worksite, until he was liberated.\u00a0</p> <p>And I remember as a young child sitting with him and tracing with my finger, the numbers tattooed into his arm. And I think so many American Jews have experiences like that one, having grown up among Holocaust survivors. And growing up among survivors, and being keenly aware of the genocide of Jews, the attempt with industrial-scale brutality to extinguish the Jewish people forever, has a profound impact on all Jews, all Jews in the United States, all Jews around the world.\u00a0</p> <p>And of course, it has a profound impact on how I view the State of Israel, recognizing that the State of Israel was established 75 years ago as Jews rebuilt in the ashes of the Holocaust, and sought to establish a secure homeland for the Jewish people.\u00a0</p> <p>I am now, as many American Jews are, deeply concerned about Israel&#39;s future, deeply concerned about the trends and dynamics and risks in the broader Middle East. And as an American policymaker, of course, particularly focused on US national security interests and other interests in the region. So I have worked for the last couple of years, to build strong working relationships, on a foundation of trust with regional leaders in Israel, in neighboring and surrounding countries, and in the Palestinian Authority, so that I can play a constructive role advancing US interests, and working to ensure that Israel can survive as a democracy and a secure homeland for the Jewish people. And also that all people in this region can one day flourish in peace and security and freedom.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman:</p> <p>Do you believe that your colleagues share that understanding of the importance of Israel, the importance of Israel to the Jewish people. And as a follow up to that, you know, we deal a lot with combating and fighting antisemitism. How much of today&#39;s antisemitism is kind of disguised as anti-Israel criticism, and has to do with a lack of understanding of the role of Israel?</p> <p>Jon Ossoff:</p> <p>Look, I think that these things can and sometimes do overlap. And I think we also have to be clear that in our free society, and as we as free citizens discuss the state of the world, we also have to avoid dismissing any critical views of Israeli policy as mere antisemitism, because there are many principled people who have a diversity of views about the Middle East region, who hold those views in good faith, not born of any kind of religious hatred.\u00a0</p> <p>You know, as for my colleagues in the Senate, I do believe that there is a growing and strong awareness of the rising tide and threat of antisemitism at this moment here in the United States, and around the world. In Georgia, just recently, there have been multiple incidents of hateful antisemitic literature being littered in the yards and driveways of Jews in different communities across the state. We&#39;ve seen, of course, a significant increase in hate crimes, violent threats, and acts of violence, targeting Jews.\u00a0</p> <p>And I was speaking recently at a Yom Hashoah event at a cemetery in Atlanta. It&#39;s an annual event that I attend, the Israeli Consul General typically attends, and local Jewish community leaders. And I heard a baby crying during the ceremony. And when I made my remarks, and as a father, my wife, Alicia, and I have an 18 month old baby daughter at home. I shared with the crowd how to me and I think to all of us how profound it was to hear a baby crying at an event remembering the unfathomable loss of the Holocaust, because that baby&#39;s voice is proof that the effort to destroy the Jewish people failed, and that we survived and that we persist.\u00a0</p> <p>But that Jewish child is also growing up at a time when antisemitism continues to grow as a threat to Jews in the United States and around the world, which requires us to be vigilant and determined, informed by our people&#39;s history. That threats to Jews have not been permanently defeated. As they have throughout history, they rise and rise again and we have to be ever vigilant.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman:</p> <p>You have confronted antisemitism in the past, some very classic conspiracy theories. I&#39;m curious how you confront that personally. And what government&#39;s role is in combating antisemitism?</p> <p>Jon Ossoff:</p> <p>There was the widely covered, widely condemned incident during my Senate campaign. When my opponent\u2019s campaign doctored an image of my face to lengthen my nose, portray me as the sort of classic caricature, antisemitic caricature. And look, of course, as a public figure, some of the hate and ill will and sometimes threats that come my way have within them or are motivated by hatred of Jews and antisemitism.\u00a0</p> <p>You know, I think as a public figure Manya, I have had to build the armor, personally necessary to protect myself and my family, to weather threats and insults that come with public life and leadership in the public arena. But for those who have not chosen a life in the public eye, you know, the swastika spray painted on the garage door, the hateful pamphlet dropped in the driveway, the threatening anonymous voicemail. You know, it&#39;s more than just upsetting and disturbing. It represents a threat to a family&#39;s safety. It represents a threat to children, to life, to property, and it undermines and can destroy the trust that we have, that our communities are open and tolerant, and based upon love and acceptance of one another, regardless of our faith. So it&#39;s a deeply worrying and corrosive and threatening dynamic in our society right now.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman:</p> <p>So, should Jewish families build a similar armor, similar to what you have developed as a public figure? Or does the government have a role in doing something to combat it?</p> <p>Jon Ossoff:</p> <p>Private citizens should not have to weather and endure and be subjected to hatred and harassment and bigotry. And there is a role for leaders in government. I work alongside my colleague, Senator Jackie Rosen of Nevada, on the bipartisan Joint Task Force on Antisemitism to develop solutions within Congress.\u00a0</p> <p>But at this moment of increased hatred, and violence, and division along all kinds of lines in our society: religious, racial, ethnic, political, cultural, all of us, leaders and citizens, are called upon to promote and defend and strengthen the loving and trusting and tolerant bonds between neighbors and fellow citizens to make our society more resilient to the fringe, which promotes hatred, and to ensure that the United States lives up to its highest ideals as a place where, regardless of where one came from, or how one worships one can be free and safe and treated with dignity.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman:</p> <p>In fact, you called for a federal task force, an inter-agency Task Force to address Antisemitism back in December. That task force has become a reality. And I&#39;m curious if you feel like that task force should be working toward more of a civil society response or actual government agencies, policies to really curb the spread of antisemitism? Or maybe it&#39;s a combination of both.</p> <p>Jon Ossoff:</p> <p>Look, I think that there is clearly a role for leaders in government and elected officials to promote and strengthen policies and ideals that defend the public against hate crimes, against violence, against harassment. And this also has to be a broader effort shared by leaders in all fields, business leaders, faith leaders, civic leaders, community leaders, and every ordinary citizen.\u00a0</p> <p>The reality is that despite how hateful and divided the public discourse can seem, and is, and despite the alarming and dangerous rise in antisemitism, and various forms of hatred, most people are deeply good. Most people are kind. Most people cherish the American ideals of equal justice, freedom of religion, and the basic idea that this is a place where people from all kinds of family backgrounds coexist and live together as Americans not on the basis of one religious creed or racial identity or national origin, but on the basis of commitment to our country&#39;s fundamental values. And I think we all have a role to play in defending and lifting up that vision of our society at a time when there is so much hate in the political and cultural and social discussion.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman:</p> <p>You interned in high school for the late Congressman John Lewis of blessed memory, a longtime dear friend of AJC. What is the direction of the relationship between black and Jewish communities in America? Where are the points of tension, the points of promising engagement? Where do we go from here?</p> <p>Jon Ossoff:</p> <p>You know, sort of an extraordinary 24 hours in Georgia\u2019s history and US History: January 5, to January 6, of 2021. On January 5, the state of Georgia, and you know, our complex history, as both the cradle of the Civil Rights Movement and the heart of the Old Confederacy, elected to the US Senate, the 33 year old Jewish son of an immigrant, and a black pastor, who holds the same pulpit that Dr. King did at Ebenezer Baptist Church. The first black senator in Georgia&#39;s history, the first Jewish Senator in Georgia&#39;s history, the first Jew elected to the Senate from the deep south since 1878.\u00a0</p> <p>And that is a powerful testament to what I was describing earlier that, you know, despite the level of hatred and division that we see in our public life, this country has come so far in terms of tolerance. But it wasn&#39;t 12 hours later, that the US Capitol was being ransacked by a hateful and violent mob. In some cases, sporting neo-Nazi and Confederate symbols, who tried to use violence, to prevent the peaceful transfer of power in our democracy, a core process in our constitutional system.\u00a0</p> <p>And so while what happened on January 5 demonstrated how far we have come, what happened the next day demonstrated the reality of the very real and present threat to those values. I mentioned that I was sworn in with, in my jacket pocket, the ship&#39;s manifests documenting my great grandparents&#39; arrivals at Ellis Island. 2</p> <p>I was also sworn in on the Tanach that had belonged to Rabbi Jacob Rothschild, who had been the longtime rabbi at the temple, the Atlanta synagogue that I attended growing up, and where I was Bar Mitzvahed. And the temple in 1958 was bombed by the Klan in retaliation for Rabbi Rothschild\u2019s alliance with Dr. King and his denunciation of segregation. And I was sworn in on that Tanach because, of course of the special role that that synagogue had played in my upbringing, but also because of the values that it represented as a possession of Rabbi Rothschild\u2019s at the moment when Senator Warnock and I had been elected.\u00a0</p> <p>And since Congressman Lewis had been a key mentor in my life, and I, so well recall that one of the first things he ever explained to me in great detail, when we sat down together, was the historic alliance between blacks and Jews in the civil rights movement, how he had marched alongside rabbis and Jews who had come to the south in the Freedom Summer to demand civil rights and voting rights. And, you know, that&#39;s a legacy of solidarity between two peoples who have had very different, but both long-term struggles against hatred, genocide. And I think it&#39;s a bond that needs to be nourished and strengthened.</p> <p>Manya Brachear Pashman:</p> <p>Do you see obstacles in the way of that?</p> <p>Jon Ossoff:</p> <p>Look in Georgia, the Jewish and black communities love one another, work closely together. And there is always room for growth. And so Manya in closing, I have to run in vote on the floor of the Senate in just a moment. I just want to, if I might, take this opportunity to reiterate what I said earlier, but at a moment like this, when there is hatred and violence, threatening and in the air, and on the ground, in reality.

Then I describe various approaches (mechanical and chemical) to slow hair loss by increasing blood flow to hair stem cells, including minoxidil, tadalafil, PRP, microneedling, Botox and ketoconazole treatments. I also discuss how age-related hormone changes cause hair loss and explain the effectiveness of treatments such as caffeine, saw palmetto, growth hormone, finasteride and dutasteride. For all hair growth options, I describe potential side effects, how soon to expect results and the amount of hair regrowth to expect and I highlight effective combination treatments for hair regrowth even in hair \u201cdead\u201d (bald) zones. For many listeners, thinning, brittle hair, or pattern baldness are a source of anxiety and stress.
